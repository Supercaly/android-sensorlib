# SensorLib

This is the official repository of the *SensorLib* library, an Android library that helps collecting real-time windowed data at a fixed frequency from the sensors inside the Android device.
The library was created to collect accelerometer and gyroscope data inside a WearOS device, but should work for any sensor and any device running android.

## The sensorlib module

Inside the project there is an Android library module called `sensorlib`. This folder is divided in three subfolders, one for each version of the library (v1, v2, v3).
